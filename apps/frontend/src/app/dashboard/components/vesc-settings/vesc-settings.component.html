    <h3>Keep having trouble configuring your VESC?</h3>
    <p>
      If configuring your VESC keeps failing it may be you have to connect your VESC through the official VESC Tool software.
      You will have to manually set the settings necessary for the Boosted ReVOLT! Dashboard to work with your VESC.
      The settings necessary can be found in the user manual of the Dashboard.
